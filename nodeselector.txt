
step 1.For example, let's say you want to label a node with the key-value pair `app=backend`:

kubectl label nodes <node-name> app=backend



Step 2: Define the Node Selector in the pod specification
Next, you need to define the Node Selector in the pod specification to indicate which nodes the pod should be scheduled on. Here's an example:


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: my-container
      image: my-image
  nodeSelector:
    app: backend
